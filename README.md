# Literally the Worst Idea

_Stolen is the ultimate non-compliant, up-only degen money game._

- __Mint for free__ - Pick any Twitter account, get an NFT representing it. You can only have up to three at a time.

- __Hodl on tight__ - Anyone can steal your NFT, but they have to pay for it. You will at least double your money*.

- __Everything is for sale__ - You don't list your NFT. You can't sell it for a loss. You can't transfer it. But you can buy it back.

Think everyone will want @elonmusk? Mint it if you still can. What's the worst that could happen?

\*Not guaranteed, DYOR

## FYI

_Not your typical ERC-721_

- Transfers are disabled. Don't try to send an NFT. It is only transferred when purchased.
- OpenSea, Blur, et al don't know how to handle this collection. You won't be able to list and sell on other marketplaces.
- Royalties of 10% are enforced at the contract level. Some or all of these royalties could be claimed by the Twitter users represented by the NFTs.
- It's possible to steal NFTs for free in rare cases. If someone buys an NFT from a non-payable contract, you can slash them and take their collection.
