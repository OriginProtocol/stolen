# Literally the Worst Idea

Stolen is the ultimate non-compliant, up-only degen money game.

Everything you know about ERC-721? Forget it.

Mint an NFT representing anyone's Twitter account. You can only have one at a time.

Anyone can "steal" your NFT, but they have to pay for it. You will* double your money.

You don't list your NFT. You can't sell it for a loss. You can't transfer it. But you can buy it back. It will cost you 4x the original price, minimum.

But you can mint anything for free. Think everyone will want @elonmusk? Mint it while you can. What's the worst that could happen?
